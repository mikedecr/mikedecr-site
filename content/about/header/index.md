# What I do:

I work in high-frequency trading as a **quantitative researcher**, which means I use

> &rarr; &nbsp; mathematical models
> 
> &rarr; &nbsp; statistics / machine learning
>
> &rarr; &nbsp; and high-powered computing tools

to study markets, build financial models, and develop principled trading strategies that go _very_ fast.

<!-- My technical specialty is Bayesian statistical modeling, also called _generative modeling_ or _probabilistic machine learning_. -->
