    I work in high-frequency trading as a **quantitative researcher**, which means I use

    > &rarr; &nbsp; mathematical models

    > &rarr; &nbsp; statistics / machine learning
    >
    > &rarr; &nbsp; and high-powered computing tools

    to study markets, develop predictive signals, and build principled trading strategies that go _very_ fast.

    #### A little more...

    I have a Ph.D. in political science from the University of Wisconsinâ€“Madison, where I was a graduate affiliate of the [Elections Research Center](https://elections.wisc.edu/).

    My graduate work developed new Bayesian approaches to measurement models and causal inference, which I used to study U.S. elections and public opinion.

    I was also an award-winning instructor.
    I taught several courses on quantitative research methods, statistics, and computing for undergraduate and graduate students.
